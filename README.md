Software depot for autonomy software for canal and dam inspection vehicle.

The code here represnts a ROS stack. It has to be cloned to a src directory of a initialised ROS workspace.

E.g.:

```
mkdir depak_ws
cd depak_ws
mkdir src
cd src
catkin_init_workspace
git clone <this-repository>
cd ..
catkin_make
```
